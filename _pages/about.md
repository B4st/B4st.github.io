I'm just a student looking to build my knowledge base and collect/organize the information that I learn in one spot. Physical notes are great but I wanted somewhere that I could link my notes with the code I'm writing, or update as I'm working online on things. This also makes it easier to access later and reference back to my own notes without constantly having to remember to bring my notebook.

Sometimes I'll be working on projects, other times I'll be collecting information on topics like network securty, cryptography, or de-identification. I might even do some capture the flag or wargame style writeups.

The purpose of this blog is to document my knowledge and share whatever I learn or find interesting. So if you find this blog has useful information as well then great, I'm happy to help others to learn along with me.
